    @param[in]
    n         rocblas_int
              number of elements in each vector x_i
    @param[in]
    x         pointer to the first vector x_i on the GPU.
    @param[in]

              specifies the increment for the elements of each x_i. incx must be > 0.
    @param[in]
    stridex   rocblas_stride
              stride from the start of one vector (x_i) and the next one (x_i+1).
              There are no restrictions placed on stride_x, however the user should
              take care to ensure that stride_x is of appropriate size, for a typical
              case this means stride_x >= n * incx.
    @param[in]
    batch_count rocblas_int
              number of instances in the batch
    @param[out]

              pointer to array for storing contiguous batch_count results. either on the host CPU or device GPU.
              return is 0.0 if n <= 0, incx<=0.

    where (A_i, x_i, y_i) is the i-th instance of the batch.
    alpha and beta are scalars, x_i and y_i are vectors and A_i is an
    m by n matrix.

    @param[in]
    handle      rocblas_handle.
                handle to the rocblas library context queue.
    @param[in]
    trans       rocblas_operation
                indicates whether matrices A_i are tranposed (conjugated) or not
    @param[in]
    m           rocblas_int
                number of rows of matrices A_i
    @param[in]
    n           rocblas_int
                number of columns of matrices A_i
    @param[in]
    alpha       specifies the scalar alpha.
    @param[in]
    A           pointer to the first matrix (A_0) in the batch stored on the GPU.
    @param[in]
    lda         rocblas_int
                specifies the leading dimension of matrices A_i.
    @param[in]

                stride from the start of one matrix (A_i) and the next one (A_i+1)
    @param[in]
    x           pointer to the first vector (x_0) in the batch stored on the GPU.
    @param[in]
    incx        rocblas_int
                specifies the increment for the elements of vectors x_i.

    stridex     rocblas_stride
                stride from the start of one vector (x_i) and the next one (x_i+1).
                There are no restrictions placed on stride_x, however the user should
                take care to ensure that stride_x is of appropriate size. When trans equals rocblas_operation_none
                this typically means stride_x >= n * incx, otherwise stride_x >= m * incx.

    y           pointer to the first vector (y_0) in the batch stored on the GPU.

                stride from the start of one vector (y_i) and the next one (y_i+1).
                There are no restrictions placed on stride_y, however the user should
                take care to ensure that stride_y is of appropriate size. When trans equals rocblas_operation_none
                this typically means stride_y >= m * incy, otherwise stride_y >= n * incy. stridey should be non zero.

    Note about memory allocation:
    When trsm is launched with a k evenly divisible by the internal block size of 128,

    used for temporary storage will default to 1 MB and may result in chunking, which in turn may
    reduce performance. Under these circumstances it is recommended that WORKBUF_TRSM_B_CHNK be set

    GEMM_EX performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

        D = alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C,

    where op( X ) is one of

        op( X ) = X      or
        op( X ) = X**T   or
        op( X ) = X**H,

    alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B, C, and D are matrices, with
    op( A ) an m by k matrix, op( B ) a k by n matrix and C and D are m by n matrices.

    Supported types are as follows:
        - rocblas_datatype_f64_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_f32_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_f16_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_f16_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type; rocblas_datatype_f32_r =
   compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_bf16_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type; rocblas_datatype_f32_r =
   compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_i8_r = a_type = b_type; rocblas_datatype_i32_r = c_type = d_type =
   compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_f32_c  = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_f64_c  = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type

    Below are restrictions for rocblas_datatype_i8_r = a_type = b_type; rocblas_datatype_i32_r =
   c_type = d_type = compute_type:
        - k must be a multiple of 4
        - lda must be a multiple of 4 if transA == rocblas_operation_transpose
        - ldb must be a multiple of 4 if transB == rocblas_operation_none
        - for transA == rocblas_operation_transpose or transB == rocblas_operation_none the matrices
   A and B must
          have each 4 consecutive values in the k dimension packed. This packing can be achieved
   with the following
          pseudo-code. The code assumes the original matrices are in A and B, and the packed
   matrices are A_packed
          and B_packed. The size of the A_packed matrix is the same as the size of the A matrix, and
   the size of
          the B_packed matrix is the same as the size of the B matrix.

    @code
    if(transA == rocblas_operation_none)
    {
        int nb = 4;
        for(int i_m = 0; i_m < m; i_m++)
        {
            for(int i_k = 0; i_k < k; i_k++)
            {
                A_packed[i_k % nb + (i_m + (i_k / nb) * lda) * nb] = A[i_m + i_k * lda];
            }
        }
    }
    else
    {
        A_packed = A;
    }
    if(transB == rocblas_operation_transpose)
    {
        int nb = 4;
        for(int i_n = 0; i_n < m; i_n++)
        {
            for(int i_k = 0; i_k < k; i_k++)
            {

    TRSM_EX solves

        op(A)*X = alpha*B or X*op(A) = alpha*B,

    where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices,
    A is triangular matrix and op(A) is one of

        op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A^T   or   op( A ) = A^H.

    The matrix X is overwritten on B.

    TRSM_EX gives the user the ability to reuse the invA matrix between runs.
    If invA == NULL, rocblas_trsm_ex will automatically calculate invA on every run.

    Setting up invA:
    The accepted invA matrix consists of the packed 128x128 inverses of the diagonal blocks of
    matrix A, followed by any smaller diagonal block that remains.
    To set up invA it is recommended that rocblas_trtri_batched be used with matrix A as the input.

    Device memory of size 128 x k should be allocated for invA ahead of time, where k is m when
    rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right. The actual number of elements in invA
    should be passed as invA_size.

    To begin, rocblas_trtri_batched must be called on the full 128x128 sized diagonal blocks of
    matrix A. Below are the restricted parameters:
      - n = 128
      - ldinvA = 128
      - stride_invA = 128x128
      - batch_count = k / 128,

    Then any remaining block may be added:
      - n = k % 128
      - invA = invA + stride_invA * previous_batch_count
      - ldinvA = 128
      - batch_count = 1

    TRSM_BATCHED_EX solves

        op(A)*X = alpha*B or X*op(A) = alpha*B,

    where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices,
    A is triangular matrix and op(A) is one of

        op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A^T   or   op( A ) = A^H.

    The matrix X is overwritten on B.

    TRSM_EX gives the user the ability to reuse the invA matrix between runs.
    If invA == NULL, rocblas_trsm_batched_ex will automatically calculate invA on every run.

    Setting up invA:
    The accepted invA matrix consists of the packed 128x128 inverses of the diagonal blocks of
    matrix A, followed by any smaller diagonal block that remains.
    To set up invA it is recommended that rocblas_trtri_batched be used with matrix A as the input.

    Device memory of size 128 x k should be allocated for invA ahead of time, where k is m when
    rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right. The actual number of elements in invA
    should be passed as invA_size.

    To begin, rocblas_trtri_batched must be called on the full 128x128 sized diagonal blocks of
    matrix A. Below are the restricted parameters:
      - n = 128
      - ldinvA = 128
      - stride_invA = 128x128
      - batch_count = k / 128,

    Then any remaining block may be added:
      - n = k % 128
      - invA = invA + stride_invA * previous_batch_count
      - ldinvA = 128
      - batch_count = 1

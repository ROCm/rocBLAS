// BLAS Level 1 includes routines and functions performing vector-vector
// operations. Most BLAS 1 routines are about reduction: compute the norm,
// calculate the dot production of two vectors, find the maximum/minimum index
// of the element of the vector. As you may observed, although the computation
// type is different, the core algorithm is the same: scan all element of the
// vector(s) and reduce to one single result.
//
// The reduction algorithm on GPU is called [parallel
// reduction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mateuszbuda/GPUExample/master/reduce3.png)
// which is adopted in rocBLAS. At the beginning, all the threads in the thread
// block participate. After each step of reduction (like a tree), the number of
// participating threads decrease by half. At the end of the parallel reduction,
// only one thread (usually thread 0) owns the result in its thread block.
//
// Classically, the BLAS 1 reduction needs more than one GPU kernel to finish,
// because the lack of global synchronization of thread blocks without exiting
// the kernel. The first kernels gather partial results, write into a temporary
// working buffer. The second kernel finishes the final reduction.
//
// For example, BLAS 1 routine i*amax is to find index of the maximum absolute
// value element of a vector. In this routine:
//
// Kernel 1: launch many thread block as needed. Each thread block works on a
// subset of the vector. Each thread block use the parallel reduction to find a
// local index with the maximum absolute value of the subset. There are
// number-of-the-thread-blocks local results.The results are written into a
// temporary working buffer. The working buffer has number-of-the-thread-blocks
// elements.
//
// Kernel 2: launch only one thread block which reads the temporary work buffer and
// reduces to final result still with the parallel reduction.
//
// As you may see, if there is a mechanism to synchronize all the thread blocks
// after local index is obtained in kernel 1 (without ending the kernel), then
// Kernel 2's computation can be merged into Kernel 1. One such mechanism is called
// atomic operation. However, atomic operation is new and is not used in rocBLAS
// yet. rocBLAS still use the classic standard parallel reduction right now.

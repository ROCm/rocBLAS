Please refer to our online documentation about the benchmarking and testing clients found
at https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocBLAS/en/latest/how-to/Programmers_Guide.html

Notes:
* Some rocblas clients utilize OpenMP which may require package installation or use of
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to locate existing runtime
* All clients using the rocblas static library build will likely require runtime code object
  loading from the rocblas/library directory tree.  If not found in standard ROCm location,
  or the application folder, use env ROCBLAS_TENSILE_LIBPATH to specify the path to the
  rocblas/library folder.

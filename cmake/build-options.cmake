# and as part of a superbuild.  If the file is included in a stand alone project, the
# variables are not expected to be preset, and this will produce options() in the GUI
# for the user to examine.  If this file is included in a superbuild, the options will be
# presented in the superbuild GUI, but then passed into the ExternalProject as -D
# parameters, which would already define them.

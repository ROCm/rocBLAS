# NOTE:  CUDA compiling path
# ########################################################################
# I have tried compiling rocBLAS library source with multiple methods,
# and ended up using the approach where we set the CXX compiler to hipcc.
# I didn't like using the HIP_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY approaches,
# for the reasons I list here.
# 1.  Adding header include directories is through HIP_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(), which
# is global to a directory and affects all targets
# 2.  You must add HIP_SOURCE_PROPERTY_FORMAT OBJ properties to .cpp files
# to get HIP_ADD_LIBRARY to recognize the file
# 3.  HIP_ADD_LIBRARY invokes a call to add_custom_command() to compile files,
# and rocBLAS does the same.  The order in which custom commands execute is
# undefined, and sometimes a file is attempted to be compiled before it has
# been generated.  The fix for this is to create 'PHONY' targets, which I
# don't desire.

# Using hipcc allows us to avoid the above problems, with two primary costs:
# 1.  The cmake logic to detect compiler features fails with nvcc backend
# 2.  Upfront cost to figure out all the strange compiler/linker flags I define
# below.

# Hopefully, cost #2 is already paid.  All in all, I want to get rid of the
# need for hipcc, and hope that at some point of time in the future we
# can use the export config files from hip for both ROCm & nvcc backends.

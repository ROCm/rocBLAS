********************************************************************
rocBLAS deprecations by version
********************************************************************


Announced in rocBLAS 4.3
==========================

rocblas_Xgemm_kernel_name APIs deprecated
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

rocblas_Xgemm_kernel_name are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of rocBLAS.

Announced in rocBLAS 4.2
==========================

gemm_ex3 deprecation for all 8 bit float API
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

rocblas_gemm_ex3, gemm_batched_ex3 and gemm_strided_batched_ex3 are deprecated and will be removed in the next
major release of rocBLAS. Please refer to hipBLASLT for future 8 bit float usage https://github.com/ROCm/hipBLASLt.

Announced in rocBLAS 2.45
==========================

Replace is_complex by rocblas_is_complex
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

From rocBLAS 3.0 the trait is_complex for rocblas complex types has been removed. Replace with rocblas_is_complex

Replace truncate with rocblas_truncate
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

From rocBLAS 3.0 enum truncate_t and the value truncate has been removed and replaced by rocblas_truncate_t
and rocblas_truncate, respectively.

Announced in rocBLAS 2.46
=========================

Remove ability for hipBLAS to set rocblas_int8_type_for_hipblas
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

From rocBLAS 3.0 remove enum rocblas_int8_type_for_hipblas and the functions rocblas_get_int8_type_for_hipblas and
rocblas_set_int8_type_for_hipblas. These are used by hipBLAS to select either int8_t or packed_int8x4 datatype.
In hipBLAS the option to use packed_int8x4 will be removed, only int8_t will be available.


Announced in rocBLAS 3.0
=========================

Replace Legacy BLAS in-place trmm functions with trmm functions that support both in-place and out-of-place functionality
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Use of the deprecated Legacy BLAS in-place trmm functions will give deprecation warnings telling
you to compile with -DROCBLAS_V3 and use the new in-place and out-of-place trmm functions.

Note that there are no deprecation warnings for the rocBLAS Fortran API.

The Legacy BLAS in-place trmm calculates B <- alpha * op(A) * B. Matrix B is replaced in-place by
triangular matrix A multiplied by matrix B. The prototype in the include file rocblas-functions.h is:

::

    rocblas_status rocblas_strmm(rocblas_handle    handle,
                                 rocblas_side      side,
                                 rocblas_fill      uplo,
                                 rocblas_operation transA,
                                 rocblas_diagonal  diag,
                                 rocblas_int       m,
                                 rocblas_int       n,
                                 const float*      alpha,
                                 const float*      A,
                                 rocblas_int       lda,
                                 float*            B,
                                 rocblas_int       ldb);

rocBLAS 3.0 deprecates the legacy BLAS trmm functionality and replaces it with C <- alpha * op(A) * B. The prototype is:

::

    rocblas_status rocblas_strmm(rocblas_handle    handle,
                                 rocblas_side      side,
                                 rocblas_fill      uplo,
                                 rocblas_operation transA,
                                 rocblas_diagonal  diag,
                                 rocblas_int       m,
                                 rocblas_int       n,
                                 const float*      alpha,
                                 const float*      A,
                                 rocblas_int       lda,
                                 const float*      B,
                                 rocblas_int       ldb,
                                 float*            C,
                                 rocblas_int       ldc);

The new API provides the legacy BLAS in-place functionality if you set pointer C equal to pointer B and
ldc equal to ldb.

There are similar deprecations for the _batched and _strided_batched versions of trmm.

Remove rocblas_gemm_ext2
''''''''''''''''''''''''
rocblas_gemm_ext2 is deprecated and it will be removed in the next major release of rocBLAS.

Removal of rocblas_query_int8_layout_flag
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
rocblas_query_int8_layout_flag will be removed and support will end for the rocblas_gemm_flags_pack_int8x4 enum in rocblas_gemm_flags
in a future release. rocblas_int8_type_for_hipblas will remain until rocblas_query_int8_layout_flag is removed.

Remove user_managed mode from rocblas_handle
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

From rocBLAS 4.0, the schemes for allocating temporary device memory would be reduced to two from four.

Existing four schemes are:

* rocblas_managed
* user_managed, preallocate
* user_managed, manual
* user_owned

From rocBLAS 4.0, the two schemes would be rocblas_managed and user_owned.
The functionality of user_managed ( both preallocate and manual) would be combined into rocblas_managed scheme.

Due to this the following APIs would be affected:

* `rocblas_is_user_managing_device_memory()` will be removed.
* `rocblas_set_device_memory_size()` will be replaced by a future function `rocblas_increase_device_memory_size()`, this new API would allow users to increase the device memory pool size at runtime.

Announced in rocBLAS 3.1
========================

Removal of __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ define
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Prior to rocBLAS 4.0, __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ was defined in rocblas.h, or more specifically rocblas-types.h, before including float.h. From rocBLAS 4.0, this
define will be removed. Users who want ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015 functionality must define __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ before including float.h and rocblas.h.

Announced in rocBLAS 4.0
=========================

Atomic operations will be disabled by default
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The default :any:`rocblas_atomics_mode` in :any:`rocblas_handle` will change in the future to :any:`rocblas_atomics_not_allowed` from the current :any:`rocblas_atomics_allowed`.
Thus the default will allow for improved determinism over performance.
Users can add explicit control and not be affected by this change by calling the function :any:`rocblas_set_atomics_mode`.

Removed in rocBLAS 4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

rocblas_gemm_ext2 removed
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

rocblas_gemm_ext2 API function was removed in 4.0.

rocblas_gemm_flags_pack_int8x4 gemm support removed
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Packed int8x4 support was removed as support for arbitrary dimensioned int8_t data is a superset of this functionality:

* rocblas_gemm_flags_pack_int8x4 enum value in rocblas_gemm_flags was removed
* struct rocblas_int8x4 was removed
* function rocblas_query_int8_layout_flag was removed
* enum rocblas_int8_type_for_hipblas type was removed

Legacy BLAS in-place trmm API removed
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The Legacy BLAS in-place trmm API is removed. It is replaced by an API that supports both in-place and out-of-place trmm.
The Legacy BLAS in-place trmm calculated

::

   B <- alpha * op(A) * B

The in-place and out-of-place trmm API calculates

::

   C <- alpha * op(A) * B

The in-place functionality is available by setting C the same as B and ldb = ldc. For out-of-place functionality C and B are different.

Removal of __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ define
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The #define __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ has been removed from rocblas-types.h. Users who want ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015 functionality
must define __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ before including float.h, math.h, and rocblas.h.

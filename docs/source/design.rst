The aim of rocBLAS is to provide:

- functionality similar to legacy blas, adapted to run on GPUs
- high performance robust implementation

rocBLAS is written in C++14 and HIP. It uses AMD's ROCm runtime to run on GPU devices.

The rocBLAS API is a thin C89 API using the `Hourglass Pattern <https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014/blob/master/Presentations/Hourglass%20Interfaces%20for%20C%2B%2B%20APIs/Hourglass%20Interfaces%20for%20C%2B%2B%20APIs%20-%20Stefanus%20Du%20Toit%20-%20CppCon%202014.pdf/>`_. It contains:

- [Level1]_, [Level2]_, and [Level3]_ `BLAS <http://www.netlib.org/blas/>`_ functions
- Extensions to BLAS for mixed precision and batched arrays
- Auxiliary functions

The original BLAS code is written in Fortran, and to maintain compatibility rocBLAS array storage format is column major and one based.

rocBLAS calls AMD's library `Tensile <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/Tensile>`_ for Level 3 BLAS matrix multiplication.

rocBLAS is initialized by calling rocblas_create_handle and it is terminated by calling rocblas_destroy_handle. The rocblas_handle is persistent and it contains

- HIP stream
- temporary device work space
- mode for enabling or disabling logging (default is no logging)

rocBLAS functions run on the host and they call HIP to launch rocBLAS kernels that run on the device in a HIP stream. The kernel launch is asynchronous unless:

- logging is enabled
- the function returns a scalar result from device to host
- temporary device memory is allocated

In all of the 3 cases above, the launch can be made asynchronous by:

- turn off logging (the default)
- use rocblas_pointer_mode_device to keep the scalar result on the device. Note that a small number of Level1 BLAS functions return a scalar result.
- use the provided device memory functions to preallocate device memory that persists in the handle. Note that most rocBLAS functions do not allocate temporary device memory.

Before calling a rocBLAS arrays must be copied to the device. Integer scalars like m, n, k are stored on the host. Floating point scalars like alpha and beta can be on host or device.

Error handling is by returning a rocblas_status. Functions conform to the Legacy BLAS argument checking.

Below is a simple example code for calling function rocblas_sscal.

.. code:: cpp

   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include "hip/hip_runtime_api.h"
   #include "rocblas.h"

   using namespace std;

   int main()
   {
       rocblas_int n = 10240;
       float alpha = 10.0;

       vector<float> hx(n);
       vector<float> hz(n);
       float* dx;

       rocblas_handle handle;
       rocblas_create_handle(&handle);

       // allocate memory on device
       hipMalloc(&dx, n * sizeof(float));

       // Initial Data on CPU,
       srand(1);
       for( int i = 0; i < n; ++i )
       {
           hx[i] = rand() % 10 + 1;  //generate a integer number between [1, 10]
       }

       // copy array from host memory to device memory
       hipMemcpy(dx, hx.data(), sizeof(float) * n, hipMemcpyHostToDevice);

       // call rocBLAS function
       rocblas_status status = rocblas_sscal(handle, n, &alpha, dx, 1);

       // check status for errors
       if(status == rocblas_status_success)
       {
           cout << "status == rocblas_status_success" << endl;
       }
       else
       {
           cout << "rocblas failure: status = " << status << endl;
       }

       // copy output from device memory to host memory
       hipMemcpy(hx.data(), dx, sizeof(float) * n, hipMemcpyDeviceToHost);

       hipFree(dx);
       rocblas_destroy_handle(handle);
       return 0;
   }

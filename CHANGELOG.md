  improvement for certain problem sizes when (m==n) measured on a gfx90a GPU)
* Performance improvements for Level 2 rocBLAS GER for float, double, and complex float precisions
  (5-7% improvement for certain problem sizes when measured on a gfx90a GPU)

* Deprecated API compatibility with Visual Studio compiler

  exceeds the available memory

### Changes

* `install.sh` internally runs `rmake.py` (also used on Windows) and `rmake.py` can be used directly on
  Linux (use `--help`)
* rocBLAS client executables all now begin with the `rocblas-` prefix

### Removals

* `install.sh` no longer has the options `-o --cov` because Tensile will now use the default COV format,
  which is set by `cmake define Tensile_CODE_OBJECT_VERSION=default`

## rocBLAS 2.46.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

### Additions

- client smoke test dataset added for quick validation using command `rocblas-test --yaml rocblas_smoke.yaml`
- Added stream order device memory allocation as a non-default beta option.

### Optimized

- Improved trsm performance for small sizes by using a substitution method technique
- Improved syr2k and her2k performance significantly by using a block-recursive algorithm

### Changes

- Level 2, Level 1, and Extension functions: argument checking when the handle is set to `rocblas_pointer_mode_host` now returns the status of `rocblas_status_invalid_pointer` only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values.  With handle mode `rocblas_pointer_mode_device` only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of `rocblas_status_invalid_pointer`.   This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behavior.
- Add variable to turn on/off ieee16/ieee32 tests for mixed precision gemm
- Allow hipBLAS to select int8 datatype
- Disallow B == C && ldb != ldc in `rocblas_xtrmm_outofplace`

### Fixes

- fix for `trsm_strided_batched rocblas-bench` performance gathering
- Fix for rocm-smi path in `commandrunner.py` script to match ROCm 5.2 and above

## rocBLAS 2.45.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

### Additions

- `install.sh` option `--upgrade_tensile_venv_pip` to upgrade Pip in Tensile Virtual Environment. The corresponding CMake option is TENSILE_VENV_UPGRADE_PIP
- `install.sh` option `--relocatable` or `-r` adds rpath and removes ldconf entry on rocBLAS build
- `install.sh` option `--lazy-library-loading` to enable on-demand loading of tensile library files at runtime to speedup rocBLAS initialization
- Support for RHEL9 and CS9
- Added Numerical checking routine for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrices, so that they could be checked for any numerical abnormalities such as NaN, Zero, infinity and denormal value

### Optimizations

- `trmm_outofplace` performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm
- herkx performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm
- syrk/herk performance improvements by utilising optimised syrkx/herkx code
- symm/hemm performance improvements for all sizes and datatypes using block-recursive algorithm

### Changes

- Unifying library logic file names: affects HBH (->HHS_BH), BBH (->BBS_BH), 4xi8BH (->4xi8II_BH). All HPA types are using the new naming convention now.
- Level 3 function argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values. With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer. This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour
- Level 1, 2, and 3 function argument checking for enums is now more rigorously matching legacy BLAS so returns rocblas_status_invalid_value if arguments do not match the accepted subset
- Add quick-return for internal trmm and gemm template functions
- Moved function block sizes to a shared header file
- Level 1, 2, and 3 functions use rocblas_stride datatype for offset
- Modified the matrix and vector memory allocation in our test infrastructure for all Level 1, 2, 3 and BLAS_EX functions
- Added specific initialization for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrix types in our test infrastructure
- Added NaN tests to the test infrastructure for the rest of Level 3, BLAS_EX functions

### Fixes

- Improved logic to #include <filesystem> vs <experimental/filesystem>
- `install.sh -s` option to build rocblas as a static library.
- dot function now sets the device results asynchronously for N <= 0

### Deprecations

- is_complex helper is now deprecated.  Use `rocblas_is_complex` instead
- The enum `truncate_t` and the value truncate is now deprecated and will removed from the ROCm release 6.0. It is replaced by `rocblas_truncate_t` and `rocblas_truncate`, respectively. The new enum `rocblas_truncate_t` and the value `rocblas_truncate` could be used from this ROCm release for an easy transition

### Removals

- `install.sh` options  `--hip-clang`, `--no-hip-clang`, `--merge-files`, `--no-merge-files` are removed

### Changes

- Modifying `gemm_ex` for HBH (high-precision F16). The alpha/beta data type remains as F32 without narrowing to F16 and expanding back to F32 in the kernel. This change prevents rounding errors due to alpha/beta conversion in situations where alpha/beta are not exactly represented as an F16
- Modified non-batched and batched asum, nrm2 functions to use shuffle instruction based reductions
- For `gemm`, `gemm_ex`, `gemm_ex2` internal API use `rocblas_stride` datatype for offset

- Improved performance of trsm with side == left and m <= 32 along with side == right and n <= 32

### Changes

- For syrkx and trmm internal API use `rocblas_stride` datatype for offset
- For non-batched and batched gemm_ex functions if the C matrix pointer equals the D matrix pointer (aliased) their respective type and leading dimension arguments must now match
- Test client dependencies updated to GTest 1.11
- non-global false positives reported by cppcheck from file based suppression to inline suppression. File based suppression will only be used for global false positives
- Help menu messages in `install.sh`
- For ger function, typecast the 'lda'(offset) datatype to `size_t` during offset calculation to avoid overflow and remove duplicate template functions

- Improved performance of syrkx for for large size including those in rocBLAS Issue #1184.

### Changes

- Update from C++14 to C++17.
- Packaging split into a runtime package (called rocblas) and a development package (called rocblas-dev for `.deb` packages, and rocblas-devel for `.rpm` packages). The development package depends on runtime. The runtime package suggests the development package for all supported OSes except CentOS 7 to aid in the transition. The suggests feature in packaging is introduced as a deprecated feature and will be removed in a future rocm release.

    - Set the `rocblas_gemm_flags_pack_int8x4` when using packed int8x4, this should be always set on GPUs before gfx908.
    - For gfx908 GPUs, unpacked int8 is supported so no need to set this flag.
    - Notice the default flags 0 uses unpacked int8, this somehow changes the behaviour of int8 gemm from ROCm 4.1.0
- Added a query function `rocblas_query_int8_layout_flag` to get the preferable layout of int8 for gemm by device

  The default is `rocblas_atomics_not_allowed`
- function `rocblas_Xdgmm` algorithm corrected and `incx`=0 support added
- dependencies:
  - `rocblas-tensile` internal component requires msgpack instead of LLVM
- Moved the following files from /opt/rocm/include to /opt/rocm/include/internal:
  - `rocblas-auxillary.h`
  - `rocblas-complex-types.h`
  - `rocblas-functions.h`
  - `rocblas-types.h`
  - `rocblas-version.h`
  - `rocblas_bfloat16.h`

### Known Issues

- Compilation for GPU Targets:
When using the install.sh script for "all" GPU Targets, which is the default, you must first set an environment variable `HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET` listing the GPU targets, e.g.  `HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET=gfx803,gfx900,gfx906,gfx908`
If building for a specific architecture(s) using the  `-a` | --architecture flag, you should also set the environment variable `HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET` to match.
Mismatching the environment variable to the `-a` flag architectures creates builds that may result in `SEGFAULTS` when running on GPUs which weren't specified.

- improved performance of Level 2 rocBLAS GER for float, double and complex float precisions. Performance enhanced by 5-7% for certain problem sizes measured on a gfx90a GPU.

### Fixed
- fixed setting of executable mode on client script rocblas_gentest.py to avoid potential permission errors with clients rocblas-test and rocblas-bench
- fixed deprecated API compatibility with Visual Studio compiler
- fixed test framework memory exception handling for Level 2 functions when the host memory allocation exceeds the available memory
### Changed
- install.sh internally runs rmake.py (also used on windows) and rmake.py may be used directly by developers on linux (use --help)
- rocblas client executables all now begin with rocblas- prefix
### Removed
- install.sh removed options -o --cov as now Tensile will use the default COV format, set by cmake define Tensile_CODE_OBJECT_VERSION=default

## rocBLAS 2.46.0 for ROCm 5.4.0
### Added
- client smoke test dataset added for quick validation using command rocblas-test --yaml rocblas_smoke.yaml
- Added stream order device memory allocation as a non-default beta option.

### Optimized
- Improved trsm performance for small sizes by using a substitution method technique
- Improved syr2k and her2k performance significantly by using a block-recursive algorithm

### Changed
- Level 2, Level 1, and Extension functions: argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values.  With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer.   This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Add variable to turn on/off ieee16/ieee32 tests for mixed precision gemm
- Allow hipBLAS to select int8 datatype
- Disallow B == C && ldb != ldc in rocblas_xtrmm_outofplace

### Fixed
- FORTRAN interfaces generalized for FORTRAN compilers other than gfortran
- fix for trsm_strided_batched rocblas-bench performance gathering
- Fix for rocm-smi path in commandrunner.py script to match ROCm 5.2 and above

## rocBLAS 2.45.0 for ROCm 5.3.0
### Added
- install.sh option --upgrade_tensile_venv_pip to upgrade Pip in Tensile Virtual Environment. The corresponding CMake option is TENSILE_VENV_UPGRADE_PIP.
- install.sh option --relocatable or -r adds rpath and removes ldconf entry on rocBLAS build.
- install.sh option --lazy-library-loading to enable on-demand loading of tensile library files at runtime to speedup rocBLAS initialization.
- Support for RHEL9 and CS9.
- Added Numerical checking routine for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrices, so that they could be checked for any numerical abnormalities such as NaN, Zero, infinity and denormal value.

### Optimizations
- trmm_outofplace performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm.
- herkx performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm.
- syrk/herk performance improvements by utilising optimised syrkx/herkx code.
- symm/hemm performance improvements for all sizes and datatypes using block-recursive algorithm.

### Changed
- Unifying library logic file names: affects HBH (->HHS_BH), BBH (->BBS_BH), 4xi8BH (->4xi8II_BH). All HPA types are using the new naming convention now.
- Level 3 function argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values. With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer. This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 function argument checking for enums is now more rigorously matching legacy BLAS so returns rocblas_status_invalid_value if arguments do not match the accepted subset.
- Add quick-return for internal trmm and gemm template functions.
- Moved function block sizes to a shared header file.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 functions use rocblas_stride datatype for offset.
- Modified the matrix and vector memory allocation in our test infrastructure for all Level 1, 2, 3 and BLAS_EX functions.
- Added specific initialization for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrix types in our test infrastructure.
- Added NaN tests to the test infrastructure for the rest of Level 3, BLAS_EX functions.

### Fixed
- Improved logic to #include <filesystem> vs <experimental/filesystem>.
- install.sh -s option to build rocblas as a static library.
- dot function now sets the device results asynchronously for N <= 0

### Deprecated
- is_complex helper is now deprecated.  Use rocblas_is_complex instead.
- The enum truncate_t and the value truncate is now deprecated and will removed from the ROCm release 6.0. It is replaced by rocblas_truncate_t and rocblas_truncate, respectively. The new enum rocblas_truncate_t and the value rocblas_truncate could be used from this ROCm release for an easy transition.

### Removed
- install.sh options  --hip-clang , --no-hip-clang, --merge-files, --no-merge-files are removed.

### Changed
- Modifying gemm_ex for HBH (High-precision F16). The alpha/beta data type remains as F32 without narrowing to F16 and expanding back to F32 in the kernel. This change prevents rounding errors due to alpha/beta conversion in situations where alpha/beta are not exactly represented as an F16.
- Modified non-batched and batched asum, nrm2 functions to use shuffle instruction based reductions.
- For gemm, gemm_ex, gemm_ex2 internal API use rocblas_stride datatype for offset.

### Changed
- Update from C++14 to C++17.
- Packaging split into a runtime package (called rocblas) and a development package (called rocblas-dev for `.deb` packages, and rocblas-devel for `.rpm` packages). The development package depends on runtime. The runtime package suggests the development package for all supported OSes except CentOS 7 to aid in the transition. The suggests feature in packaging is introduced as a deprecated feature and will be removed in a future rocm release.

- For function syr avoid overflow in offset calculation.

    - For gfx908 GPUs, unpacked int8 is supported so no need to set this flag.
    - Notice the default flags 0 uses unpacked int8, this somehow changes the behaviour of int8 gemm from ROCm 4.1.0
- Added a query function rocblas_query_int8_layout_flag to get the preferable layout of int8 for gemm by device

  The default is rocblas_atomics_not_allowed
- function rocblas_Xdgmm algorithm corrected and incx=0 support added
- dependencies:
  - rocblas-tensile internal component requires msgpack instead of LLVM
- Moved the following files from /opt/rocm/include to /opt/rocm/include/internal:
  - rocblas-auxillary.h
  - rocblas-complex-types.h
  - rocblas-functions.h
  - rocblas-types.h
  - rocblas-version.h
  - rocblas_bfloat16.h

  These files should NOT be included directly as this may lead to errors. Instead, /opt/rocm/include/rocblas.h should be included directly. /opt/rocm/include/rocblas_module.f90 can also be directly used.

### Known Issues
- Compilation for GPU Targets:
When using the install.sh script for "all" GPU Targets, which is the default, you must first set an environment variable HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET listing the GPU targets, e.g.  HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET=gfx803,gfx900,gfx906,gfx908
If building for a specific architecture(s) using the  -a | --architecture flag, you should also set the environment variable HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET to match.
Mismatching the environment variable to the -a flag architectures creates builds that may result in SEGFAULTS when running on GPUs which weren't specified.
